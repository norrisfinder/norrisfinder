- 👋 Hi, I’m @norrisfinder
- 👀 I’m interested in developing high income skills that will be beneficial to the future, as we are heading into a more technologically dependent society.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Fullstack, but I'm just getting started on my coding journey and only know a small amount of HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project. As a future coder, I want to be known in the industry as the guy that everybody wants on their team, and competitiors to fear through my work ethic!
- 📫 How to reach me: I may be reached through my email at tylerodell2@hotmail.com, I will attach a phone number at a later time or through the email provided.
